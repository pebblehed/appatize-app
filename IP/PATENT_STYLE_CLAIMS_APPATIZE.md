# APPATIZE — Patent-Style Claims (Foundational Protection Document)
Version 1.0 — © Appatize Ltd.

This document outlines patent-style claims describing the novel mechanisms, 
architectures, and processes invented within Appatize.

## Claim 1 — Multi-Layer Cultural Intelligence Architecture
A hierarchical intelligence system comprising:
(a) a Model Shaping Environment (MSE) that governs creative behaviour  
(b) a Cultural Intelligence Engine (CIE) that interprets cultural signals  
(c) an operational pipeline that transforms signals → angles → briefs → scripts.

## Claim 2 — Behaviour-Control Influence Curves
A novel method for modifying generative output by applying 
energy, tone, rhythm, and platform-defined curves 
to internal reasoning *before* generation occurs.

## Claim 3 — Moment Shaping Logic
A proprietary mechanism for interpreting real-time cultural signals 
and converting them into “moments” that drive narrative, format, 
and creative positioning.

## Claim 4 — Angle Generation Intelligence
A reasoning engine using contrast modelling, micro-intent detection, 
narrative gravity weighting, and platform-native heuristics to produce 
strategic creative angles.

## Claim 5 — Brief Intelligence Scaffold
A structured system that converts strategic angles into creative briefs 
with narrative, emotional, rhetorical, and platform-specific instructions.

## Claim 6 — Anti-Detection Narrative Deviation
A linguistic modelling process that applies controlled asymmetry, 
creator heuristics, pacing variance, and human-like deviations 
to reduce detectable AI patterns.

## Claim 7 — Multi-Origin Cultural Signal Fusion
A system capable of ingesting and weighting signals from Reddit, TikTok, X, 
YouTube, Instagram, and other cultural sources into unified creative intelligence.

These claims define the core inventive step behind Appatize.
