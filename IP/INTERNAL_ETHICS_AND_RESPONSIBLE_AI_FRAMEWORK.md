# Internal Ethics & Responsible AI Framework
Version 1.0 — © Appatize Ltd.

Appatize is committed to building responsible, culturally aware AI systems.

## Principles
1. **Cultural Respect**  
   Outputs must avoid stereotypes, harmful narratives, or exploitative framing.

2. **Creator Protection**  
   AI enhances creators, not replaces or undermines them.

3. **Transparency & Integrity**  
   Internally, reasoning structures and data handling follow ethical guidelines.

4. **Data Responsibility**  
   No scraping or storing personally identifiable information.
   Multi-origin cultural signals must comply with platform terms.

5. **Human-Layer Governance**  
   The intelligence system supports human judgment; it does not override it.

6. **Bias Mitigation**  
   CIE must be continuously assessed for cultural, demographic, and geographic bias.

This framework will evolve with Appatize’s intelligence.
