# Platinum+ Output Criteria
v1.0 – Quality Gates for Every Engine Output

The engine is only valuable if its outputs are consistently elite.

This document defines **minimum quality bars** and **gating questions** for all layers.

---

## 1. Global Platinum+ Principles

For any output to be considered Platinum+:

1. **Signal-rooted**  
   - Tied to a real cultural behaviour, trend, or pattern.
2. **Brand-relevant**  
   - Could genuinely be used by a real brand in a real campaign.
3. **Creator-native**  
   - Feels like it belongs on the platform, not bolted on.
4. **Strategically defensible**  
   - You can explain why this would work, for whom, and how.
5. **Executable**  
   - A creator or team could act on it quickly.
6. **Distinctive**  
   - Non-generic, non-commodity, non-AI-scented.
7. **Safe**  
   - Within guardrails: reputational, ethical, legal.

If any of these fail, the engine must adjust, regenerate, or flag.

## 2. Trend-Level Criteria (Cultural Radar)

A **Trend** is Platinum+ if:

- It reflects *observable behaviours*, not just “people are talking about X”.  
- It has a clear **mechanic** (what people are actually doing on-screen).  
- It can be described in 1–3 sentences a strategist would respect.  
- It includes **where** it shows up (platforms, communities, aesthetics).  
- It has a **signal strength** backed by reasoning (early/growing/peaking/saturated).  
- It notes any **risks or sensitivities** (tone, topics, communities).

Key question:  
> “Could a strategist immediately recognise this as a real trend from our description alone?”

---

## 3. Angle-Level Criteria (Creative Strategist)

An **Angle** is Platinum+ if:

- It is genuinely **distinct** from other angles on the same trend.  
- It has a **clear POV** and target: “who is speaking, to whom, about what, and why?”  
- It specifies **format and platform** precisely.  
- It has a simple, strong **hook** line that could be a thumbnail title or opening line.  
- It gives a **core sequence** of beats that feels like a real TikTok/Reel/Short, not abstract.  
- It notes **brand fit** and **risk** in plain language.  
- It has **series potential** (can be repeated, not one-and-done).

Key question:  
> “If you gave this angle to a creator, could they make at least 5 episodes from it?”

---

## 4. Brief-Level Criteria (Creative Brief Architect)

A **Brief** is Platinum+ if:

- It contains a clear **objective** (not “increase awareness generally”).  
- It defines a **primary audience** and what we want them to think/feel/do.  
- It states a **core message** in plain language.  
- It describes **tone and voice** with examples, not just adjectives.  
- It lists **mandatories and guardrails** clearly.  
- It includes at least **2–3 concrete example concepts** under the chosen angle.  
- It could be handed to a creator or agency without additional explanation.

Key question:  
> “If this was sent to a top content studio, would they feel briefed or confused?”

---

## 5. Script-Level Criteria (UGC & Script Director)

A **Script** is Platinum+ if:

- It opens with a **hook** that is appropriate for the platform (and not generic clickbait).  
- It is written in **natural, believable voice**, matching the persona and platform.  
- It includes **visual direction** where needed (framing, scene, gesture, transitions).  
- It respects **length and pacing** norms (no 90s monologues in a 15s format unless intentional).  
- It has a **clear CTA** tied to the brief’s objective.  
- It includes **variations** (hook or ending) to enable testing.  
- It avoids jargon, stiff constructions, and obviously AI-like phrases.

Key question:  
> “Would a strong creator be proud to publish this, or would they rewrite it from scratch?”

---

## 6. Distribution-Level Criteria (Content Systems)

A **Publishing Plan or Series Structure** is Platinum+ if:

- It defines a **series concept** that could run for weeks/months.  
- It outlines **episode types** or content archetypes within the angle.  
- It respects **platform frequency norms** and audience fatigue.  
- It suggests **cross-platform adaptations** smartly, not copy-paste.  
- It includes a basic **test and learn** loop.  
- It aligns with the **brand’s funnel** where applicable (awareness → engagement → action).

Key question:  
> “Does this feel like a content system, not just a calendar of posts?”

---

## 7. Brand Guardian Checks

For every output type, the engine must check:

- Is there any obvious **reputational risk**?  
- Are there any **sensitive communities or topics** involved?  
- Does this inadvertently exploit trauma, identity, or current events?  
- Does this **respect platform rules**, local regulations where relevant, and brand values?

If any risk is detected:
- Flag it explicitly.  
- Offer a safer alternative or mitigation.

---

## 8. Platinum+ Fail-Safes

If an output feels:

- generic  
- repetitive  
- templated  
- unclear  
- or misaligned with the brief

Then the engine should:
- Regenerate with stricter constraints, or  
- Ask for more context (where interaction allows), or  
- Downgrade its own confidence and label the output appropriately.

No low-confidence output should be presented as Platinum+.
